# Project Idea

## Title: 
Revolutionizing Beverage Packaging Waste: AI-Powered Classification for Efficient Sorting and Recycling

---

## Idea: 



**I want my project to be able to (1) classify Beverage Packaging Waste using the (2) camera on my (3) mobile device**





---

## Data:

I will use the ["Drinking Waste Classification"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkadiyhacks/drinking-waste-classification) dataset published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).  

**About the Dataset:**

4 classes of drinking waste: Aluminium Cans, Glass bottles, PET (plastic) bottles and HDPE (plastic) Milk bottles. This dataset was manually labelled and collected as a part of final year Individual Project at University College London.
